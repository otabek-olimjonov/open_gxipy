# HS Soft Python API

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL PUBLISH ON PYPI OF THE GXIPY API DEVELOPED BY HS Soft!**  
> I'm not the developer and maintainer of the Python API, nor the Galaxy SDK. For any questions or issues, **please contact HS Soft directly**.

HS Soft develops the Galaxy SDK and also offers a Python API for using it. However, they do not publish the API on PyPi, which reduces its ease of installation. Therefore, I published the API on PyPi.  

## Usage
1. Install the Galaxy SDK for your operating system from the [HS Soft Download Page](https://www.get-cameras.com/customerdownloads#Aion%20SDK)
2. Run `pip install open_gxipy`
3. Read the Python API user manual : [Python Interface Development User Manual.pdf](https://github.com/otabek-olimjonov/open_gxipy/blob/main/Python%20Interface%20Development%20User%20Manual.pdf)

## Python API source files
> [!NOTE]
> If a new version of the Python API is offered by HS Soft, please create an issue or a PR, and I will update the Package on PyPi.

When you install the Galaxy SDK, the official Python API is automatically installed locally. You can find the API files here:  
- **Windows**: In `C:\Program Files\HS Soft\GalaxySDK\Samples\Python SDK\gxipy`
- **Linux**: In `Galaxy_Linux_Python_X.X.X.X\api\gxipy`

@AionVision If you want me to remove this package from PyPi, please create an issue on the [Github repo](https://github.com/otabek-olimjonov/open_gxipy).
